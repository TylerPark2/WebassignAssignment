## 2. Core Technologies
### Frontend Technologies:
- **HTML5**: Structure of the game, for rendering the game screen and managing interactivity.
- **CSS3**: For responsive design and visual styling of the UI, menus, and in-game effects.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core game mechanics, event handling, and player interaction logic. The game will be developed using a modern JavaScript framework.
- **WebGL (via Three.js or Babylon.js)**: Rendering the 3D game environment, characters, and objects with high-performance graphics.
- **Canvas API**: For 2D rendering of HUD, weapons, and effects like ammo count, health bar, and wave progression.
  
### Backend Technologies (for multiplayer or persistent features):
- **Node.js with Express.js**: If multiplayer functionality or backend game logic is necessary (i.e., high scores, data storage, and player sessions).
- **WebSockets (Socket.io)**: For real-time multiplayer interactions and synchronization between clients.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing player profiles, high scores, game statistics, etc.
- **REST API**: For game data retrieval and player interaction (login, high scores, etc.).

### Game Engine:
- **Phaser.js** (for 2D) or **Babylon.js** (for 3D): An open-source HTML5 game engine for efficient game mechanics, physics, and rendering.
- **Custom AI Pathfinding**: For zombies using A* or navigation mesh algorithms to follow the player and handle collisions.

## 3. Game Functionality
### A. Player Movement & Combat
- **Controls**: 
  - **WASD** for movement (forward, backward, left, right).
  - **Mouse for aiming** and **left-click for shooting**.
  - **R key** for reloading.
  - **Shift key** for sprinting.
- **Combat System**: 
  - **Weapons**: Multiple weapon types such as pistols, shotguns, rifles, and explosives. 
  - **Weapon Characteristics**: Different fire rates, reload speeds, and ammo capacities.
  - **Ammo Management**: Ammo is limited and found in-game, requiring strategic collection and usage.
  - **Damage Calculation**: Weapons deal different damage based on type (e.g., headshots for more damage).
  
### B. Resource Management
- **Ammo**: Limited resources; must be found or earned through kills or milestones.
- **Health**: Health packs appear randomly. Health is reduced upon contact with zombies and is displayed on the HUD.
- **Power-Ups**: Temporary boosts like faster reload, damage increase, or invulnerability.

### C. Zombie Behavior
- **Zombie Types**:
  - **Basic Zombie**: Slow, low health.
  - **Fast Zombie**: Agile, high speed, medium health.
  - **Tank Zombie**: Slow-moving but heavily armored with high health.
  - **Special Zombies**: Zombies with unique abilities (e.g., exploding on death, cloaking, ranged attacks).
- **AI Pathfinding**: Zombies use a navigation mesh or pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A* or navmesh) to follow players, avoid obstacles, and reach the playerâ€™s location.
- **Group Behavior**: Zombies act in packs, exhibiting swarm behavior when close to the player.

### D. Wave Progression
- **Wave System**: 
  - Waves increase in difficulty (more zombies, stronger zombies, faster zombies).
  - **Boss Zombies**: Appear on milestone waves, requiring special strategies.
  - **Wave Timers**: Players must survive each wave until all zombies are eliminated.
  - **Enemy Spawn Points**: Randomized locations for zombie spawns to prevent predictable patterns.
  - **Wave Transition**: Between waves, players get a brief reprieve to restock and upgrade.

### E. User Interface (UI)
- **HUD Elements**:
  - **Score Display**: Shows total kills and points.
  - **Health Bar**: Displays remaining health.
  - **Ammo Counter**: Shows current/total ammo for the equipped weapon.
  - **Wave Counter**: Shows the current wave number and remaining enemies.
- **Menus**:
  - **Main Menu**: Options include Start Game, Loadout Selection, Tutorial, and Settings.
  - **Pause Menu**: Allows the player to pause, resume, or return to the main menu.
  - **Game Over Screen**: Displays final score, number of zombies killed, and waves survived, with options to retry or return to the main menu.

## 4. Aesthetics
### Visual Design
- **Graphics**: 
  - **Environment**: A dark, post-apocalyptic urban setting with broken buildings, abandoned vehicles, and decaying landscapes.
  - **Player Model**: Realistic player character with animations (idle, walking, sprinting, shooting).
  - **Zombie Models**: Varied zombie designs with decayed and rotting flesh, designed to be visually distinctive and horrifying.
- **Lighting**: Dynamic lighting to create a dark, atmospheric setting, with flashlights and muzzle flashes illuminating areas.
- **Effects**: Blood splatter, explosions, gunfire muzzle flashes, and particle effects (e.g., dust, sparks).

### Color Scheme:
- **Dark and muted colors** (grays, browns) for the environment.
- **Sickly green** and brown tones for zombie designs.
- **Bright Red** for health, yellow for ammo, and white for wave information.

## 5. Sound & Music
- **Sound Effects**:
  - Gunfire, footsteps, zombie groans, and ambient environmental sounds (wind, distant noises).
  - **Zombie Sounds**: Groans, growls, and screeches based on type.
- **Background Music**: Intense and suspenseful music that ramps up with each wave to increase tension.
- **Voice Acting**: Optional character lines or brief dialogue for player actions or in-game events (e.g., "Need ammo!" or "Boss approaching!").
