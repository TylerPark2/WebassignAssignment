# Suggestions

The format is kind of confusing and it could be better structured for clarity - you mention a lot of the same thing throughout the document but with different levels of details

How do you get ammo/get more ammo? Does it spawn?

What kind of loadout/weapons? Is there a way to switch between guns or have multiple
How do the zombies behave? Randomly or are they drawn to you

How much health do you lose when you come in contact with a zombie 

How many zombies per wave? Is there something signaling a new wave, or a time in between? How long between waves, or does it start after you kill all the current zombies

How does scoring work? Is it how long you stay alive or how many zombies you kill?

Get rid of tech specs details at end
